# Topoint syntax

To integrate a library: "import" .

To create a function: "func ()".

To initialize: "do".

To finish a function: "exit".

To create a print: print(" "). Inside of a print you insert the content.
	
To register a value: ask(" ").

Numerical value: "num", num is supposed to act both as an integer and a floating.

List: a set of values.

Loops representation:

-tail: the equivalent of the "for" loop
(the c++ for will also be functional if it`s on an algorithm).
Tail works with the integration of a "put" function, which will establish the tail loop.

-while: the common while loop, no more differences.

Operations:
The Operation "%" (to calculate a remainder) will be accepted on the algorithm,
as well as an equivalent called "rem".
