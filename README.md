## What is Topoint?

The Topoint project is a creative exercise to practice the standards of programming languages such as c++, python and lua, by creating a brand new
language inspired by the syntax of all three, but proposing a new way of logic (with a simpler and dinamic visualization). Although itÂ´s still on development.
